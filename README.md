Quick reference:
```
sensor:
  - platform: rte_ecowatt
    api_client_id: XXXX
    api_client_secret: YYYY
    sensors:
      - unit: days
        shift: 2
      - unit: days
        shift: 0
      - unit: hours
        shift: 7
      - unit: hours
        shift: 36
```

Each sensor is configured to look at ecowatt level in the future. You can configure X hours in advance (up to 96 at the moment) to get the precise level at a given point in time.
You can also configure X days in advance (up to 3 days) to get the worst level of that day.
